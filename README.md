# DNA-Origami-RNAP



An "X" shaped DNA origami rotor is attached to a strand of DNA that is fed though the enzyme RNA polymerase. The tip of one of the rotor arms is tracked, its movements in time are recorded in the csv file. The x- and y- values in the csv file describe the location of the tip of one of the rotor blades as it moves with the DNA. Each row is a time step with difference between rows = 20 ms


RNAP Average File:
This shows the static graphs of RNAP activity as function of time on the z axis and displacement from the center on the x and y axis. 
The displacement on the x axis was found by taking the average of the original x data and subtracting that average from each x data value
The same was done to find the replacement on the y axis
