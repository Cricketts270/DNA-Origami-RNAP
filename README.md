RNAP Average File:
This shows the static graphs of RNAP activity as function of time on the z axis and displacement from the center on the x and y axis. 
The displacement on the x axis was found by taking the average of the original x data and subtracting that average from each x data value
The same was done to find the replacement on the y axis
